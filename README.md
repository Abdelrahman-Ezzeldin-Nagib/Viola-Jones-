# Viola-Jones-
Viola Jones ( Haar features Cascade ) Algorithm for face features detection in python 
using OpenCV2
this detects the face, eyes and smile (mouth)
we used the Haar Cascade files which can be downloaded from here
https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades
All you will have to do is use the directory for the Haar Cascade files in your computer 
this project supports multi faces detection
works for real time detection
support scale invariant and robust
